# New Relic integration for IBM MQ (newrelic-ibm-mq-monitor)

The newrelic ibm mq monitor allows you to monitor the performance of MQ Objects like channels and queues while also enabling easy alerting.

## Installation

1. Unzip the newrelic-ibm-mq-monitor 

## Configuration

Rename the plugin.template.json to plugin.json. Edit all parameters to your environment. 

### Global Properties

The "global" object in plugin.json contains general properties application to the monitor.

- **account_id**: your new relic account id. You can find it in the URL that you use to access newrelic. For example: https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/{accountID}/applications
- **insights_mode**:
	- The insights_insert_key provided here will be used to post metrics to New Relic.
- **proxy**: Enter the proxy setting in this section if a proxy is required. 
	- "proxy_host": the proxy host name or ip addresss
	- "proxy_port": the proxy port
	- "proxy_username": (optional) proxy user name
	- "proxy_password": (optional) proxy password
- **queueIgnores**:  An array of "ignoreRegEx" objects. The value of the object is a regular expression. Any queue name on any queue manager that matches the regular expression will be ignored (i.e. no metrics collected). The array can contain any number of entries.
- **queueIncludes**: Overrides queueIgnores with same format. This allows wildcard excludes but then the ability to explicitly include specific queues here.

### Instance Properties

The **agents** array in **plugin.json** contains objects each of which contain properties specific to an IBM MQ Queue Manager that is to be monitored.
Each instance can have the following properties

- **name**: any descriptive name for the queue manager
- **host**: hostname or IP for the queue manager
- **port**: port number that the queue manager is listening on
- **queueManager**: the name of the MQ queue manager to connect to.
- **channel**: channel name used to connect to the queue manager. Typically you can use SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN
- **username**: username used to connection 
- **password"**: password used to connection 

### Password Obfuscation
For additional security, this integration supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the proxy_password_obfuscated attribute. Similarly, it also supports obfuscating any other password attribute by appending "_obfuscated" to the attribute name and providing an obfuscated value. 

The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following [New Relic CLI](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli)  command:

```

newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value "CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD"

```

The obscuring key must also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable.

## Starting the monitor 

## Building

1. Build the project: `gradle clean build`
2. Copy the resulting contents of `build/distributions` folder into newrelic-ibm-mq-monitor folder.
